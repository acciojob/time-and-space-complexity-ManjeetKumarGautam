	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. Writing efficient algorithms is crucial to handling large-scale problems effectively.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of its input size. A common space complexity is O(n), where the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
